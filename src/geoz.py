Geographic Decision Zones (GeoZ)
==================================
GeoZ is a Python module integrating several machine learning algorithms to create Geographic Maps for the output of 
Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques. The module is geared mainly toward delineating the output from Clustering algorithms.
See (https://github.com/Ne-oL/geoz) for complete documentation (under construction).

def convex_hull_plot(latlong, y_pred, grid_resolution=100, colormap='Set3'):

'''
    This Function creates a Convex Hull for each set of points that belong to a distinct cluster using Shapely's "convex_hull" 
    (https://github.com/shapely/shapely) to eventually draw a map that contains all the clustered data. The usage of this method and 
    its main advantage is to detect any clear overlapping in the clustering algorithm as the other methods can draw overlapped regions.
    However, due to its geometrical nature, the method isn't capable of accurately delineating the clusters regions nor should it be 
    used for that. This method doesn't invlove any machine Learning Algorithms, thus it execute quickly and is suited for prototyping
    the clustering algorithm's parameter to a certain degree.
    
    Parameters
    ----------

    latlong : DataFrame
        The Latitude and Longitude Coordinates of the Data points. The DataFrame must contain two columns,
        These columns should be named 'LONGITUDE','LATITUDE' verbatim.
        
    y_pred : List
        The y_pred is the Clustering prediction of the samples submitted to the algorithm, the results need to be saved
        in a list array with a (-1) dimension.
        
    grid_resolution : int, default=100
        Number of grid points to use for plotting decision boundary. Higher values will make the plot look nicer but a bit 
        slower to render.
        
    colormap : str or Colormap, optional
        A Colormap instance or registered colormap name. The colormap maps the level values to colors. 
        Defaults to "Set3".  

    
    Returns
    -------   
    ax: matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot
        The returned Object is an AxesSubplot, it will display automatically in IPython environments. the figure can also
        be called using the (.figure) attribute. this will allow the user to manipulate it or save it using matplotlib as backend.

    '''
    This Function utilize Scikit-Learn's "DecisionBoundaryDisplay" (http://scikit-learn.org) to draw the map. 
    The advantage of this method is that it gives the user a lot of flexibility to modify and adjust the map 
    to his liking, as opposed to the other method in GeoZ library, this method is better suited for prototyping 
    and quick drafts as one of the option available to the user allows him to reduce the resolution, thus 
    produce more maps in a short amount of time.
    
    Parameters
    ----------

    latlong : DataFrame
        The Latitude and Longitude Coordinates of the Data points. The DataFrame must contain two columns,
        These columns should be named 'LONGITUDE','LATITUDE' verbatim.
        
    y_pred : List
        The y_pred is the Clustering prediction of the samples submitted to the algorithm, the results need to be saved
        in a list array with a (-1) dimension.
        
    SVC Parameters:
    
        C : float, default=1.0
            Regularization parameter. The strength of the regularization is inversely proportional to C. Must be strictly positive. 
            The penalty is a squared l2 penalty.
        
        gamma : {‘scale’, ‘auto’} or float, default=30
            Kernel coefficient for ‘rbf’, ‘poly’ and ‘sigmoid’.
                * if gamma='scale' (default) is passed then it uses 1 / (n_features * X.var()) as value of gamma,
                * if ‘auto’, uses 1 / n_features
                * if float, must be non-negative.
            in the GeoZ library, the gamma parameter serves mainly as a controller to the buffer zone around the points of the 
            cluster, as well as the inerconnectedness of the distant points within the same cluster/class. Decreasing this 
            parameter would increase the buffer zone around the points and thus increase the uncertinity of the clusters boundaries. 
            decreasing it would decrease the buffer zone around the points and consequently decreaseing the uncertinity of the 
            clusters boundaries.
        
    grid_resolution : int, default=100
        Number of grid points to use for plotting decision boundary. Higher values will make the plot look nicer but be 
        slower to render.
        
    colormap : str or Colormap, optional
        A Colormap instance or registered colormap name. The colormap maps the level values to colors. 
        Defaults to "Set3".  
        
    show_points : bool, default True
        Display the points used to create the Decision Boundary. This would allow the user to check the accuracy of the model
        as well as any artifacts or missing clusters, thus alerting the user to enable bazel_cluster function.
        
    bazel : bool, default False
        This option allows the Function to creates a Bazel round the study area, the defaults are robust but not guaranteed to work.
        its pretty easy to check if the function worked or not by looking at the final map/Decision Boundary plot, if the map 
        have a Bazel, it means the method did NOT work and the user needs to adjust the default values to increase generated 
        data points to force the model to consider the Bazel cluster as the background. if it works, the map will be clear, 
        showing only the clusters of interest without the Bazel showing.
        
    n_samples : str or array (optional)
        This variable is generated based on the provided dataset, you only need to modify it if the method failed to force 
        SVM Classifier to consider the cluster as a background. The 'default' value takes the number of samples
        in the largest cluster and increase it by one and use it to create the bazel cluster.
        
    extent : int, default=1
        The "width" of the generated Bazel, there should be no need to change this variable, however, if the method
        failed after manipulating n_samples, The default can be increase to 2 or 3 while adjusting the n_samples
        accourdingly.    
        
    random_seed : int (optional)    
        Sets Numpy Random Seed as a constat for Reproducibility. This mainly affect the randomness of the Bazel samples
        distribution within the extent parameter.
    
    Returns
    -------   
    ax: matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot
        The returned Object is an AxesSubplot, it will display automatically in IPython environments. the figure can also

    '''
    This Function utilize Mlxtend's "decision_regions" (http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/) to draw the map. The advantage of 
    this method is that it gives the user a very detailed map with high resolution, in addition to that, it uses different
    colors decision regions AND Sympoles for data points to represent different clusters. this shows great advantage over
    default color schemes used in Scikit-Learn (can be changed), as the number of clusters increase, the number of 
    colors used increase forcing the algorith to cycle through the same set and confusing the users, thus adding symploes
    to differentiate between clusters in addition to colors help significantly. however, the increased accuracy limits
    the usage of this method as it takes a lot of time to draw which is a considerable disadvantage when prototyping. 
    This plotting method should be the choice for the final exported map.
