## Notebook Examples:

### All the Jupyter Notebook examples in this folder can be run directly in Google Colab using one of these two methods:

1. Replace "github.com" in the notebook URL with "githubtocolab.com".

2. Install the "[Open in Colab](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo)" Chrome extension.

 **Caution: While the notebooks will open in Colab, the datasets need to be uploaded manually to colab for the code to work.**
