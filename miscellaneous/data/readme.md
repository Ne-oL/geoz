# Synthetic Dataset used in GeoZ examples and illustration

The dataset (**GeoZD.csv**) was created using the awesome [drawdata](https://github.com/koaning/drawdata) library. It contains 3 columns [latitude, Longitude, label], and 6761 rows, representing almost 7 thousand different locations scattered around UAE to demonstrate the library abilities and functionalities. 

A smaller version of the dataset (**GeoZDMin.csv**) contains 68 row, approximately ~1% of the (GeoZD) dataset. This dataset was created to demonstrate the abilities of the voronoi_regions_plot as the function is specialized in dealing with small datasets.
